Breast cancer is cancer that develops from breast tissue. Signs of breast cancer may include a lump in the breast, a change in breast shape, dimpling of the skin, fluid coming from the nipple, a newly inverted nipple, or a red or scaly patch of skin. In those with distant spread of the disease, there may be bone pain, swollen lymph nodes, shortness of breath, or yellow skin. Risk factors for developing breast cancer include being female, obesity, a lack of physical exercise, alcoholism, hormone replacement therapy during menopause, ionizing radiation, an early age at first menstruation, having children late in life or not at all, older age, having a prior history of breast cancer, and a family history of breast cancer. About 5–10% of cases are the result of a genetic predisposition inherited from a person's parents, including BRCA1 and BRCA2 among others. Breast cancer most commonly develops in cells from the lining of milk ducts and the lobules that supply these ducts with milk. Cancers developing from the ducts are known as ductal carcinomas, while those developing from lobules are known as lobular carcinomas. There are more than 18 other sub-types of breast cancer. Some, such as ductal carcinoma in situ, develop from pre-invasive lesions. The diagnosis of breast cancer is confirmed by taking a biopsy of the concerning tissue. Once the diagnosis is made, further tests are done to determine if the cancer has spread beyond the breast and which treatments are most likely to be effective. The balance of benefits versus harms of breast cancer screening is controversial. A 2013 Cochrane review found that it was unclear if mammographic screening does more harm than good, in that a large proportion of women who test positive turn out not to have the disease. A 2009 review for the US Preventive Services Task Force found evidence of benefit in those 40 to 70 years of age, and the organization recommends screening every two years in women 50 to 74 years of age. The medications tamoxifen or raloxifene may be used in an effort to prevent breast cancer in those who are at high risk of developing it. Surgical removal of both breasts is another preventive measure in some high risk women. In those who have been diagnosed with cancer, a number of treatments may be used, including surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and targeted therapy. Types of surgery vary from breast-conserving surgery to mastectomy. Breast reconstruction may take place at the time of surgery or at a later date. In those in whom the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, treatments are mostly aimed at improving quality of life and comfort. Outcomes for breast cancer vary depending on the cancer type, the extent of disease, and the person's age. The five-year survival rates in England and the United States are between 80 and 90%. In developing countries, five-year survival rates are lower. Worldwide, breast cancer is the leading type of cancer in women, accounting for 25% of all cases. In 2018 it resulted in 2 million new cases and 627,000 deaths. It is more common in developed countries and is more than 100 times more common in women than in men.



Brustkrebs oder Mammakarzinom (von lateinisch mamma \"Zitze, Brust; weibliche Brustdrüse\") ist der häufigste bösartige Tumor der Brustdrüse des Menschen. Er kommt hauptsächlich bei Frauen vor; nur etwa jede hundertste dieser Krebserkrankungen tritt bei Männern auf. In den westlichen Staaten ist Brustkrebs die häufigste Krebsart bei Frauen. Am Brustkrebs sterben mehr Frauen als an irgendeiner anderen Krebserkrankung. Die meisten Erkrankungen treten sporadisch (zufällig) auf, es gibt aber sowohl erbliche als auch erworbene Risikofaktoren. Neben der Heilung sind der Erhalt der betreffenden Brust und vor allem der Lebensqualität erklärtes Ziel der medizinischen Behandlung.Die Therapie besteht in der Regel in einer an das Erkrankungsstadium angepassten Kombination aus Operation sowie Zytostatika-, Hormon- und Strahlentherapie. Neue Ansätze aus dem Gebiet der Krebsimmuntherapie werden außerdem durch monoklonale Antikörper (wie z. B. durch die Verabreichung von Trastuzumab oder Pertuzumab) ermöglicht. Das medizinische Vorgehen basiert in hohem Maß auf Erfahrungen aus Studien, folgt oft der evidenzbasierten Medizin und ist in weltweit akzeptierten Leitlinien standardisiert. Zahlreiche nationale und internationale Programme zur Früherkennung und zur strukturierten Behandlung sollen die Mortalität (Sterblichkeit) künftig senken.

Introduction. As an interdisciplinary organization dedicated to advancing the science and practice of nutrition support therapy the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (A.S.P.E.N.) works vigorously to support quality patient care, education, and research in the fields of nutrition and metabolic support in all healthcare settings. To promote safe and effective patient care by nutrition support practitioners, the A.S.P.E.N. Board of Directors published \\\"Guidelines for the Use of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition in Adult and Pediatric Patients\\\" in 19931 and 2002. The format and methodology of the Clinical Guidelines (CG)s have changed over time, as a result of A.S.P.E.N.'s ongoing efforts to improve the clarity and usefulness of the guidelines. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) has recently redefined Clinical Practice Guidelines as \\\"statements that include recommendations intended to optimize patient care that are informed by a systematic review of evidence and an assessment of the benefits and harms of alternative care options.\\\". To be trustworthy IOM states that CGs should be based on a systematic Address correspondence to: Charlene W. Compher PhD, RD CNSC, LDN, FADA, University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing, Claire M.

In 2009,4 rather than publishing a single, allencompassing compilation of guideline recommendations, A.S.P.E.N. began to issue a series of focused CG documents addressing specific nutrition support practices in age and diagnostic groups.\r\nMore recently, A.S.P.E.N moved to endorse the recommendations of a working group for the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE),4-6 with modifications needed for nutrition support research while continuing A.S.P.E.N.'s rigorous review and approval processes. This paper provides the reader with an introduction to the GRADE methodology as applied to A.S.P.E.N Clinical Guidelines. Background. The implementation of the GRADE methodology represents a further advance in the process of guideline development at A.S.P.E.N. The GRADE system was developed to standardize clinical guideline language and grade levels across documents from many professional organizations.

The number of professional organizations (Box 1) that have endorsed or are using GRADE since its introduction in 2004 attests to an emerging consensus regarding the applicability of this system across a broad spectrum of clinical circumstances. In addition, GRADE separates into two distinct processes the evaluation of the body of evidence from the statement of a recommendation. Situations may exist, for example, in which consideration of clinical risk results in a strong recommendation despite relatively weak published evidence. The GRADE process is rigorous, provides the basis for clinically relevant recommendations and includes tables of evidence with complete references that serve as a resource to readers seeking more in depth information. Box 2 provides further information regarding the advantages of the GRADE system over other approaches to development of CGs. The A.S.P.E.N. Clinical Guidelines are based on a series of pertinent clinical questions that have been articulated by the authors, Clinical Guidelines Editorial Board, reviewers, and A.S.P.E.N. members. A careful search of the published literature is used to find the best available evidence to answer the question. Each identified article is then evaluated with its data entered into an Evidence Table for each question (Table 1). The GRADE system recognizes that the quality of the available evidence underlies our confidence in any recommendation that is made (Table 2). Clinical studies that are randomized controlled trials (RCT) are recognized as the strongest published clinical Box 1.

Many research reports with nutrition support outcomes are observational, either prospective or retrospective reports of clinical outcomes associated with a given therapy (but not randomized, controlled protocoldriven care). The evidence provided by these observational studies is strengthened, however, when the effects shown are strong, when the sample size is large, or when there is a doseresponse relationship. The criteria in Table 3 are used to adjust the evidence grade based on assessment of the quality of study design and execution. When the only available evidence is expert opinion most commonly from expert panels, then the quality of the evidence is very low. After all references have been evaluated, the authors meet to decide by consensus the recommendation that should be made. Table 4 is the GRADE Table that summarizes the body of evidence to support a given recommendation and states the grade or strength of that recommendation. Table 5 describes the standard language and rationale for the grade assigned to a recommendation. The A.S.P.E.N Clinical Guidelines process retains the many layers of internal, external, and legal review that have taken place in earlier guidelines documents. These combined efforts should result in transparent, evidencebased, safe and effective clinical guidelines for use in nutrition support decisionmaking, using the best available evidence at the time of the review. An ongoing literature search has been implemented in order to monitor when new publications suggest a need to reevaluate a given topic and its clinical guideline. Acknowledgments. A.S.P.E.N.
